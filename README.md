üí° Data-Driven Business Recommendations
1.  Scale Profitable Products

Recommendation:           Expand toy inventory and promotions in Chicago, Phoenix, and Houston to leverage proven profitability.
üìà Potential ROI increase by 10‚Äì15% by focusing marketing on top 3 cities for Toys.

2. Optimize High-Cost, Low-Profit Categories
Fitness has the highest manufacturing cost ($84,099) but ranks lower in total profit compared to Toys or Home Appliances.
Recommendation:        Review fitness product pricing or reduce SKUs to cut manufacturing overhead.
Estimated savings of $10K‚Äì$15K by cutting the least profitable fitness items.

3. Refine Supplier Strategy
Supplier B offers consistently lower average costs across categories:
Toys: $222 (B) vs. $257 (C)
Beauty: $122 (B) vs. $148 (C)
Recommendation:         Shift orders toward Supplier B where quality is acceptable.
Reducing reliance on Supplier C can lower procurement cost by up to 12%.

4. Unlock Beauty Product Potential
Beauty products have lowest manufacturing cost ($72,611) but don‚Äôt appear in top profit categories.
Recommendation: Apply pricing experiments or bundle offers to increase margins.
Target profit increase of $2M+ annually if Beauty products are scaled properly with a pricing adjustment.

5. Location-Based Budget Optimization
Los Angeles and New York generate moderate profit, but with higher supplier and manufacturing costs.
Recommendation:           Reallocate budget from LA to cities with higher ROI like Chicago and Phoenix.
Strategic shift could enhance profit by ~8% annually through better market targeting.
